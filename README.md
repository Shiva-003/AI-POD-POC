## Short term goals after review

Dockerize - standartize the app so that we can actually deploy it somewhere
Check if everything works
Make proper branching, dev, qa, staging, prod
Make some changes that we talked about with Shivam
Try to make a webview mobile app for Android and IOS
Figure out if these are the right models for us
Do some proper storage and email service
Signal R or websocket for notifications
